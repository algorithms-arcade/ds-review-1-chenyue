###  Project - Scope and Closure

Apply your learnings from the preclass material and guided project to a project with detailed guidelines. You should work on this for approximately 3 hours and utilize the internet, help channels, and other resources if you get stuck.

In this challenge you will work through a variety of exercises to build a console version of a baseball scoreboard that takes into account innings, strikes, outs, and more!
