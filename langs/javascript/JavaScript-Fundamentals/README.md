[Home - Javascript](../README.md)

One of the most powerful web languages is JavaScript. Without it, there is no web. All web browsers use JavaScript in some fashion to power rich user experiences for those interacting with a web page or application.

JavaScript is everywhere today! And we have the opportunity here to dive deep enough into the language to teach you how to be proficient in building modern, complex and beautiful web applications that are used to power the web today!

## [Scope and Closure](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/README.md)

This module will give you practice with function scope and closures. Closures are an important programming concept that often come up in job interviews. Closure can help solve complex problems with ease, and builds nicely off of what you've been learning the past few days.

-   [Objective 1 - explain function scope](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/Objects/Object_1.md)

-   [Objective 2 - describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/Objects/Object_2.md)

-   [Scope and Closure - Assignment](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/index.js)

-   [Scope and Closure - Guided](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/note131.js)

-   [Project - Scope and Closure](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/Objects/Project.md)

-   [Check For Understanding](./Module_1-Scope-and-Closure/Objects/Understanding.md)

## [Advanced Array Methods](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/README.md)

This module will give you practice with advanced array methods such as .map, .filter, and .reduce and introduce you to the idea of callbacks. Both advanced array methods and callbacks will make it easier to interact with large data sets, like we started in the last sprint. As you progress in your journey as a web developer, these will likely become some of your favorite tools for both displaying data, and dealing with user data.

-   [Objective 1 - demonstrate the proper use a of a callback function by passing a function to another function as a parameter](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/Objects/Object_1.md)

-   [Objective 2 - demonstrate ability to use .map .reduce .filter and describe their use cases](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/Objects/Object_2.md)

-   [Advanced Array Methods - Assignment](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/index.js)

-   [Advanced Array Methods - Guided](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/note132.js)

-   [Project - Advanced Array Methods](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/Objects/Project.md)

-   [Check For Understanding](./Module_2-Advanced-Array-Methods/Objects/Understanding.md)

## [Prototypes and Inheritance](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/README.md)

This lesson introduces us to the this keyword and it's many uses. After we learn about this we are prepared to discuss prototypes in JavaScript and explore how they are in every aspect of JavaScript.

-   [Objective 1 - explain the four principles of the 'this' keyword and demonstrate each explanation with an example of their uses](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/Objects/Object_1.md)

-   [Objective 2 - describe and use prototypes, constructor functions the new keyword, and pseudo-classical inheritance](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/Objects/Object_2.md)

-   [Prototypes and Inheritance - Assignment](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/index.js)

-   [Prototypes and Inheritance - Guided](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/note133.js)

-   [Project - Prototypes and Inheritance](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/Objects/Project.md)

-   [Check For Understanding](./Module_3-Prototypes-and-Inheritance/Objects/Understanding.md)

## [Javascript Classes](./Module_4-Classes/README.md)

JavaScript IV introduces you to the powerful paradigm of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. We will take a deep dive into these topics:

-   The JavaScript Prototype object
-   constructor functions
-   Pseudo-classical Inheritence
-   the class keyword

By the end of the day you should be familiar with objects and how to use Constructors and Classes to build out objects and achieve inheritance across these objects.

-   [Objective 1 - describe and demonstrate how class syntax works](./Module_4-Classes/Objects/Object_1.md)

-   [Objective 2 - convert a pseudo classically instantiated program into class syntax](./Module_4-Classes/Objects/Object_2.md)

-   [Classes - Assignment](./Module_4-Classes/index.js)

-   [Classes - Guided](./Module_4-Classes/note134.js)

-   [Project 1.3.4 - Classes](./Module_4-Classes/Objects/Project.md)

-   [Check For Understanding](./Module_4-Classes/Objects/Understanding.md)
